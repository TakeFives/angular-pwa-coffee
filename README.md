# AngularPwa - Angular Progressive Web App

Welcome to my Angular Progressive Web App (PWA) project! This project is the result of completing the Progressive Web App Development course with Angular. In this course, I've learned how to leverage Angular's capabilities to create modern web applications that behave like native apps across various platforms.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.0.

## Overview

Progressive web apps (PWAs) combine the best features of web and mobile apps, offering a seamless user experience regardless of the device or platform. With this Angular PWA project, the aim is to showcase the principles and techniques learned during the course and demonstrate the capabilities of PWAs.

## Features

- Modern Web Technologies: Built with Angular, utilizing the latest web standards and best practices.
- Progressive Enhancement: Enhance user experience progressively, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of devices and browsers.
- Offline Access: Utilize service workers and caching strategies to enable offline access, allowing users to use the app even without an internet connection.
- App Installation: Support installation on devices, enabling users to add the app to their home screens for quick access, just like a native app.
- Responsive Design: Ensure the app is responsive and optimized for various screen sizes, providing a consistent experience across devices.
- Web Services Integration: Interact with web services seamlessly, handling different network conditions gracefully.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.

## Project Backend

The backend for this project is hosted separately at [angular-pwa-coffee-backend](https://github.com/TakeFives/angular-pwa-coffee-backend). It is a Node.js project that utilizes the simple nedb database to store data. This backend serves as the data storage and management system for the Angular Progressive Web App, providing essential functionalities for seamless user experience.
